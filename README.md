# Insta_BOT
"I have developed an Instagram bot using Python and the Instagram API, designed to perform a variety of tasks such as automating posts, liking, commenting, following, and unfollowing. This bot enhances user engagement and streamlines social media management by automating routine interactions, ultimately saving time and improving efficiency."
"I created an advanced Instagram bot using Python and the Instagram API that fetches user credentials from a .txt file for seamless authentication. Once logged in, the bot performs a wide range of tasks including automating posts, liking, commenting, following, and unfollowing. The bot's flexibility allows it to be extended and integrated with additional tasks such as direct messaging, story posting, and user interaction tracking. This makes it a powerful tool for automating various Instagram interactions, enhancing productivity, and reducing manual effort in managing social media activities."
